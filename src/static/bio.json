After two years of teaching, I decided that the profession was not a good fit for me and I moved onto other things; I worked as a server and bartender at Chili's in Hadley, MA for a few years, after which I moved to Boston and took a job as a dog walker and petsitter. In addition, I spent my Summers working as a wilderness trip leader and outdoor education director at Birch Rock Summer Camp in Waterford, ME. While in Boston, I was fortunate to meet my wife, Samantha; who loves dogs as much as I do."

Hopefully I'll have a chance to give it another go someday."
